# BouncingBall-p5
This is a test website to host a p% project that I recently learned. The code is mostly from Prof Evan Peck with revisions from Professor Xiannog Meng. My p5js editor is for this repository [https://editor.p5js.org/spm016/sketches/t5ehNNUw_]. Below is a screenshot of the program. Note the program generates a video, the balls bounce back and forth inside a predefined screen frame.

The website that runs the program is at [https://spm016.github.io/BouncingBall-p5/]
